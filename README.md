# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using a machine learning classification model. The analysis helps identify factors contributing to customer churn and provides insights into retention strategies

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as losing customers leads to decreased revenues and increased customer acquisition costs. This project aims to use historical customer data to predict whether a customer will churn or stay with the company. The project also includes a comprehensive data visualization using Power BI to highlight key trends and patterns in churn behavior.

## Key Components

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and converted `TotalCharges` from object to numeric.
   - Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical features and scaled numerical data.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized key customer demographics and behavior patterns using Power BI.
   - Analyzed correlations between customer attributes and churn rates.

### 3. **Model Building**
   - Trained multiple machine learning models to predict customer churn:
     - **Logistic Regression** (Best model with 82% accuracy)
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Gradient Boost
     - Naive Bayes
     - XGB Boost
   - Logistic Regression was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the model using classification metrics including:
     - **Accuracy**: 82%

### 5. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer churn trends, and retention strategies
